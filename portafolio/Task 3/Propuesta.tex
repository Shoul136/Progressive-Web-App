	\fontsize{9}{10}\selectfont % Adjust font size
	Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are a rapidly growing tool in today's technology landscape. Over time, it has been demonstrated that tools are increasingly moving towards smaller, simpler, and less robust environments. Creating multi-platform systems that generate fewer expenses, provide constant updates, and maintain data persistence in secure environments is crucial for reacting to any loss of connection and ensuring system flexibility.
	
	Implementing a PWA for our project can bring significant benefits to all employees using the system, reducing costs and normalizing a single environment where developers can be more proactive and less concerned about building a service from scratch.
	
	\section*{Why Choose a PWA for Our Project?}
	\fontsize{9}{10}\selectfont % Adjust font size
	Choosing a PWA for our project is a strategic decision based on our goals for product functionality, developer flexibility, user convenience, and cost-effectiveness in implementation.
	
	Simplifying the software usage for security guards when addressing their tickets in the security system will ensure that the system operates smoothly and that nothing unusual is happening within the integrated system.

	To control entries and exits at specific locations within different departments of a company, safeguarding tools, consumables, and documentation.
	
	\section*{Usability When Adding New Devices}
	\fontsize{9}{10}\selectfont % Adjust font size
	In the context of a security environment, effectiveness and simplicity in managing devices are essential to ensure a robust and reliable system. Adopting a Progressive Web App (PWA) for incorporating new devices, such as motion sensors and fingerprint sensors, can be the key to simplifying and significantly improving the installation process.
	
	Imagine our installation technician, carrying only their mobile phone. With the PWA, the process starts directly from their device, without the need to download additional applications. This not only saves time but also simplifies device management, allowing the technician to focus on the task at hand rather than dealing with complex installation processes. The intuitive interface of the PWA guides the technician through each step of the installation, making it easy to set up new devices with just a few clicks. Cross-platform compatibility ensures that the technician can use their own device, regardless of the platform, eliminating limitations and facilitating widespread adoption.
	
	Furthermore, the PWA offers practical benefits such as instant updates and offline functionality. Updates are implemented automatically, ensuring that the technician always has the latest version of the installation tool. In situations where connectivity is limited, the PWA remains fully functional, allowing the technician to complete the installation without interruptions. Security and privacy are paramount in security systems, and the PWA does not compromise on these aspects. It complies with high-security standards, providing a reliable environment for the incorporation of sensitive devices.
	
	\section*{Local Connection}
	\fontsize{9}{10}\selectfont % Adjust font size
	In the following scenario, we will explore the advantage of having a situation where internet connectivity is poor and we need to continue monitoring sensor data during these periods of connection loss.
	
	Our security technician is in an environment where internet connectivity is intermittent or even non-existent. This is where the magic of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) comes into play, offering significant advantages that can revolutionize the way we record and update sensors, especially in offline areas. One of the main advantages of PWAs is their ability to function offline. This means that our technician can register new motion sensors and fingerprint sensors even in remote areas, without relying on network availability. The PWA will provide a smooth user experience and allow the technician to perform all essential functions for installation without obstacles.
