	\section*{Introduction}

	For our project, we will exclusively control access to authorized personnel within rooms, specific locations, and designated areas. This is aimed at preventing unauthorized personnel from entering using fingerprint validation for entries through a magnetic lock.

	This system will also be utilized to generate reports, gather statistics, and provide alerts to prevent unauthorized individuals from attempting access. With these tools, quick measures can be taken to prevent any incidents in the shortest possible time.
	
	\section*{Security Control Requirements}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Entry and exit control of specific locations within and outside areas.
